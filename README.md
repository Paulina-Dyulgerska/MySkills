# REACT Web Project

<b>MySkills is a project that presents the results from my REACT training and summarizes the content of my professional and education life.</b>

Conformity Check is dedicated to manage legal conformity requirements that different product types must comply with. 

In this <b>complicated regulatory world</b>, we have many <b>different product legislations, regulations, country laws and customer requirements that have to be confirmed</b>.

<b>The main goal of the project is to act as a document and regulatory management system</b>.

Very common and typical case in the companies that produce <b>single or complex articles/products</b>, is to have <b>articles that need several different confirmations</b>. At the same time, these articles could have more than one supplier and the **management of the documents provided by each supplier for each article for each specific conformity type** is a **huge burden** even for the biggest companies in the World. 
In addition to the fact that **articles could be delivered for more than one source, we have separate requirements valid for different countries or clients**. 

This poses the need of a web tool, that could **manage the documents, create records, relationships, generate reports, send requests and update the information provided by the suppliers**. 
Even in the current state of the art with all available software tools on the market, **the need of a system that could do all those things together and be fit to the production specifics of the today’s supply management is still high**. 
The **companies are facing more and more issues collecting, managing, evaluating and analysing the information**, subsequently – **delivering this information on request by clients, customs or control authorities around the World**. 

When we add the **inevitable fact that regulations and requirements in all the countries are changing very frequently**, that the **specific restrictions are different in different countries** and the **raising awareness in human society for the environmental and people protection needs, laws and requirements**, it is **absolutely mandatory all companies to be able to manage the conformity topic with a tool that fits exactly to their needs**.

-	Distributed Memory Cache - SQL Server:
o	The logic is that the general view with report returned for all major entity types is generated by the order - last created one. In the cache we store with relative expiration time of 5 minutes all the records from the first page (12 records by default paging view model settings). If the user creates a new record, it will not be seen immediately, but this record will be findable be the search option available and by other sorting options except the default one! Conformity types are cached for 1 year because they are very few and rarely modified. Because the user expects to see immediately the new created ones, we update the cache after create, edit or delete of a conformity type. In the distributed cache we hold the Home/Index general counts collection for 5 minutes. In the Views we cache all view components for the general entities: all are kept for 2 minutes, just the conformity types are kept for 20 minutes since they are rarely modified. Time is relatively set.
